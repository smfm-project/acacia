Graphical User Interface
========================

``acacia`` comes in as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This is the preferred option to use ``acacia``, but of course if you ar handy in Python feel free to extract the script from the file ``Acacia.py`` and make it your own.

Using the acacia Graphical User Interface (GUI)
---------------------------------------------

The ``acacia`` Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows you to use `acacia` with minimal usage of the command line. In your terminal or the `Anaconda prompt` (if you're using Windows), navigate to the folder where you stored `acacia` by typing:

.. code-block:: console

    cd /full/path/to/acacia/

This folder should have a file called ``Acacia.py``. 

To open the GUI, type:

.. code-block:: console

    python Acacia.py

The GUI window should then open. Now you can use `acacia` several times with minimal typing.
